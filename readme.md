# HOPEtensor

**HOPEtensor** is a decentralized AI confederation and reasoning infrastructure designed to reduce hallucinations, eliminate single-model dependency, and enforce ethics **by design**.

HOPEtensor is not a single model.
It is a **federated intelligence system** governed by verification, coordination, and conscience (*Vicdan*).

---

## What This Repository Is

This repository contains a **working local prototype and reference implementation** of the HOPEtensor architecture.

The system demonstrates how decentralized AI systems can produce **verifiable, accountable, and ethically constrained outputs**.

---

## Architecture Overview

HOPEtensor is composed of multiple specialized nodes:

- Reasoning Nodes  
- Verification Node  
- Ethics Node (Vicdan)  
- Coordinator Node  
- Observer / Audit Node
